    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, an ML system is trained using large amounts of data and algorithms that give it the ability to learn how to perform the task."

    "#### 1. Data Collection  \n",
    "-Everything starts with data: numbers, images, text, clicks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-The quality and quantity of data heavily influence the performance of ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data Preprocessing  \n",
    "-Raw data is often messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning (removing noise or missing values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization (scaling values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction (turning raw data into useful inputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model Training  \n",
    "-A machine learning algorithm learns patterns from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-The algorithm adjusts internal parameters to reduce error, which we measure using a loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluation  \n",
    "Test the model on new, unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (for classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Mean Squared Error (for regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Prediction  \n",
    "Once trained and evaluated, the model is used to make predictions or decisions."
