    "## DBSCAN\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm used in machine learning to group similar data points together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s how it works in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Core idea: It groups points that are close to each other, based on a distance measure, and ignores points that are too far away (treating them as \"noise\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Îµ (epsilon): the maximum distance between two points to be considered neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "minPts: the minimum number of points needed to form a dense region (a cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it forms clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts with a point and checks how many neighbors it has within Îµ distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it has enough neighbors (at least minPts), it becomes a core point, and a cluster starts growing from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighboring points are added to the cluster if theyâ€™re close enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until no more points can be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: Points that donâ€™t fit into any cluster are labeled as noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why itâ€™s useful: DBSCAN can find clusters of different shapes and sizes, and it doesnâ€™t need you to specify the number of clusters in advance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ§  Three Types of Points in DBSCAN:  \n",
    "Core Point: Has at least minPts points (including itself) within a radius of Îµ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Border Point: Has fewer than minPts points within Îµ but is close to a core point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise Point (Outlier): Not a core or border point; too far from any dense region."
